EEG-based Epileptic Seizure Classification Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code, scripts, and documentation for a system that classifies EEG signals as seizure or non-seizure using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to support epilepsy diagnosis and research by automating the classification of EEG data segments.

ðŸ§  Overview
Classification Task: Uses ML algorithms to label EEG segments as seizure or non-seizure.

Feature Extraction: Statistical, temporal, and frequency-based features are extracted from the signals.

Models: Implements and compares algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess performance.

Interactive UI: Streamlit front-end for users to upload EEG data and view results.

ðŸš€ Features
Data preprocessing and signal filtering.

Feature extraction from EEG recordings.

Multiple ML classifiers for flexible model selection.

Visual data exploration and performance reporting.

Simple app interface for demonstration.

ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn)

Streamlit (for user interface)

MNE-Python (EEG signal handling)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization)

How to Use
