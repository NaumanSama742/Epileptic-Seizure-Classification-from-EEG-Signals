EEG-Based Epileptic Seizure Classification Using Machine Learning
A machine learning project to classify epileptic seizure events from EEG signals. This repository includes all necessary code, a sample EEG dataset, and interactive Jupyter notebooks to help users reproduce results or adapt the workflow for their own data.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to classify EEG data segments as seizure or non-seizure. The main goal is to automate and support epilepsy diagnosis by leveraging feature extraction, ensemble classifiers, and experimental visualization.

üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
DATABASE/

Contains EEG data in Excel format (Epileptic Seizure Recognition.xlsx or .csv).

PHOTOS/

Example plots and visualizations generated during analysis.

epileptic seizure classification notebook.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the full workflow: preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and visualization.

‚ö° Main Features
Data preprocessing and EEG signal filtering.

Extraction of statistical and frequency-based features.

Multiple ML classifiers: Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression.

Performance metrics reporting (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

Interactive notebook for visualization and experimentation.

Repository includes both the dataset and sample notebooks for hands-on use.

üìä Dataset
Format: Microsoft Excel/CSV.

Location: /DATABASE/Epileptic Seizure Recognition.xlsx

The dataset is labeled for supervised ML classification (seizure vs. non-seizure).

Users can modify or replace the dataset for their own research.

üìî Jupyter Notebook
File: epileptic seizure classification notebook.ipynb
